# And This is the summary

### Use of useState Hook: You've effectively used the useState hook to manage state in your components, such as items, description, and quantity.

Event Handling: You’ve created event handlers like handleEvent and handleSubmit to handle form submissions and updates to the state.

Component Structure: You've structured your application into multiple components (Navbar, Forms, Packing, and App), promoting modularity and reusability.

State Lifting: You've practiced lifting state up by passing state and event handlers as props to child components, enabling parent components to manage shared state.

List Rendering and Keys: You’ve learned to render lists of items and the importance of using unique keys for each item in the list to help React efficiently update and manage the UI.

Basic Form Handling: You’ve handled form input and submission, resetting the form fields after submission, which is a common requirement in many applications.
